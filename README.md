Problem Understanding

Retailers in B2B marketplaces often face challenges in discovering relevant products, optimizing orders, and exploring new opportunities. Most purchases are repetitive, leading to stagnant growth for retailers and missed revenue for distributors. Limited personalization, lack of regional insights, and poor discovery tools worsen the problem.

Proposed Solution

We propose an AI-powered Intelligent Recommendation System integrated into the marketplace platform. Using collaborative + content-based + trend-aware models, the system provides:

Personalized product recommendations

Regional trend analysis

Smart cart suggestions with profit insights

Seasonal & festival-aware discovery

Voice & vernacular search for easy adoption


Uniqueness

Unlike generic recommendation engines, our solution is tailored for B2B retail ecosystems. It combines:

Hyperlocal insights (regional demand patterns)

Community-driven discovery (peer circles & reviews)

Gamified adoption (rewards for trying new products)

Auto-replenishment with exploration (predicts needs + suggests new items)


This makes the system not just about recommendations, but about growth-focused decision-making for retailers.

Impact

Retailers: Higher discovery of profitable products, 15â€“20% increase in average order value, and reduced stockouts.

Distributors/Marketplace: Improved sales conversion, faster product adoption, and stronger retailer retention.

Ecosystem: Supports MSMEs in scaling efficiently, contributing to digital retail growth in India.
